# Chicks Gold - FE Assessment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.

In order to run this project, Node.js (`v^18.16.0`) must be installed. This can be done by downloading the executable through the [official website](https://nodejs.org) or using NVM (*Node Version Manager*) ([Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), [macOS/Linux](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)), in case another version of Node.js is installed in the computer.

To install the aforementioned version with NVM, run the following commands in the CMD/console of preference:

### Windows/macOs/Linux

```
nvm install 18.16.0
nvm use 18.16.0
```

To check if Node.js was correctly installed, run the following commands. If the installation was completed successfully, then the version of Node.js and NPM should be seen in the console.

```
node -v
npm -v
```

Once the repository is cloned, locate into the root folder of the project and install the dependencies using the next command:
```
npm i
```
Or
```
npm install
```

To run the Angular development server, use the following command and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` with the browser of preference in order the view the application:
```
ng s
```
Or
```
ng serve
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
